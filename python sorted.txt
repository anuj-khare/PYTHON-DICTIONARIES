Python sorted() function is used to sort an iterable.
There are quite a few things to take note of when you are using sorted function in python:
1)Python sorted() always returns a new list.
2)There are two optional arguments that can be used with python sorted: key and reverse.
3)sorted() can be used on any iterable while .sort() method can only be used with a python list.
Also,when dealing with .sort() method , always remember that we cannot get back to the original list after using sort method.However, if we sorted() function was used,
getting access to the original list would still be possible since sorted() returns a new sorted list.
4).sort() method does not return anything while sorted() does.
Now , we have talked enough about all of this.Time to see a few examples to demonstrate these points and after that , we'll see how and where to use key and reverse 
arguments while using sorted() in python.

mylist = [1,12,33,50]
print(id(mylist))
#sorted on mylist returns a sorted list.
print(sorted(mylist))
#the next print statement will return False as sorted doesnt manipulates the original list.
print(sorted(mylist) is mylist)

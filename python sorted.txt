python sorted is used for sorting an iterable.
there are quite a few things to take note of when you are using sorted function in python:
1)python sorted always returns a new list.
2)there are two optional arguments that can be used with python sorted: key and reverse
3)sorted can be used on any iterable while .sort() can only be used with a python list
Also,when dealing with .sort() method , always remember that we cannot get back to the original list after using sort method.However, if we used the sorted function,
we can still have the access to the original list since sorted always returns a nwe list.
4).sort() does not return anything while sorted() does.
Now , we have talked enough about all of these time to see a few examples to demonstrate these points and after that , we'll see how and where to use key and reverse 
arguments while using sorted in python .
